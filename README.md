Iâ€™ve always been driven by the desire to create, when i was 5, after building some lego pseudo-robot I always felt that I was building something big. Today at 23, this feeling persists, but now with web development. Using all my UX and Front-end knowledge not only to solve problems, but to help changing fundamentally how stuff works.

**Web is everywhere and everyone is on the web, things are changing and it is a pleasure to be part of it.**
